                I have a strong musical background after having done intstrumental studies for over seven years. 
                In those seven years I learned how to play the piano, guitar, and had the chance of playing in a band as well
                as working with the philharmonic orchestra.

               In the future I hope to work in the broadcast journalism field, hopefully as an assitant producer. 
               I first realized this is what I wanted to do in the future thanks to the University of Miami offering the 
               very exclusive broadcast journalism major, as well as having all the very high tech equipment needed.
